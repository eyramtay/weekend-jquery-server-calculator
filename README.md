### jQuery Server Calculator

1. The problem is: we need a functioning calculator that takes in two numbers that can be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided by each other, and then the answer is displayed on the DOM. 

2. Once the answer is displayed, you should be able to hit the "clear" button and the inputs will be cleared and then the math problem will be displayed on the DOM in an unordered list (kind of like displaying a visual history).

3. The server.js file will also have a history of the math problems that have been performed and will keep the history even if you hit the refresh button on your browser. The history will only disappear if you stop and restart your web server.
